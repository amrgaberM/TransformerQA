# PaperQA: Advanced RAG Chatbot for "Attention Is All You Need"

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application enabling interactive conversations with the seminal AI paper "Attention Is All You Need." This system provides accurate information retrieval and complex reasoning capabilities based solely on the paper's content.

## Overview

PaperQA represents a fully functional RAG implementation designed to bridge the gap between static research documents and interactive knowledge exploration. The system combines state-of-the-art embedding models with modern language generation capabilities to create a conversational interface for technical content.
